                        Having extensive knowledge of a subject matter does not equate with communicating it effectively. Your knowledge remains dormant, unless you feel comfortable, and confident with yourself, your material and your audience.

                    <p class='secondaryFocus'>

A novice presenter or an experienced executive who presents often, will increase and strengthen their communication skills, guaranteed. Enroll up to 6 participants per consultant.

                    <p class='mainFocus'>
                        To have Professional Presence, one must exhibit confidence, competence, and credibility under pressure, as well as under normal business conditions. You must communicate in an effective verbal, and non-verbal manner. Non-verbal body language has the most impact on our communication.
                    </p>
                    <p class='secondaryFocus'>
                        When making a first impression, critical perception occurs in 30 seconds. Our physical appearance, including attire, posture, eye contact and handshake, are the first non-verbal characteristics observed by others. Too much technology can and has depersonalized many of our relationships. Do you know how your clients perceive you and your organization? How about your peers, colleagues and manager? What could you do differently to enhance your presence in and out of the office?
