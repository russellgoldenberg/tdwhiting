                    <h3>Executive coaching</h3>
                    <p class='first'>
                        Executive coaching creates a trusting and collaborative environment in which personal development and performance improvement occur.  It establishes a real, self-perception of current professional behavior and the impact it has on self, the organization and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Approach:</span> The focus is on your advancement as you define it. Coaching provides a confidential one-on-one opportunity between a professional coach and a mid - high level leader that promotes reflection, improved managerial style, communication effectiveness, and encouragement to execute vision. Process includes a needs assessment, definition of expectations, followed by a specific action plan, mentoring, modeling and a 360&deg; feedback exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>360&deg; Feedback:</span> Whiting Consulting has a unique process that eliminates the use of computer-generated questionnaires.  Theresa conducts personal interviews with direct reports, colleagues and managers, which result in a formalized feedback summary document to the client.  The summary includes general comments, leadership style, communication effectiveness, recommendation and action plan.

                    <h3>Career coaching</h3>
                    <p class='first'>
                        Career coaching provides significant value and answers to finding a career that works for you.

                        <span>Approach:</span> We utilize a tool that targets how you habitually take action, make decisions, and view others. Career coaching creates an environment for you to take inventory on your current job, finances, goals, strategy, resume, and overall professional choices for the future.

                        Having adequate knowledge of a subject matter does not equate to communicating effectively. Your knowledge remains dormant, unless you feel comfortable, and confident with yourself, your material and your audience. Presentation, and communication skills training is vital for success.
