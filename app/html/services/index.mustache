                    <h3>Executive coaching</h3>
                    <p class='first'>
                        Individualized coaching provides a one-on-one development opportunity tailored to the specific goals of the executive. Each session begins and ends with a clearly defined action plan to maximize time and results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Process:</span> An executive coaching process is initiated with a needs assessment, definition of expectations, coaching objectives, action plan, skill practices, videotaping, mentoring, modeling behaviors and 360 feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whiting Consulting uses a personal, proven, unique 360 feedback process. This process includes individual face to face interviews with managers, colleagues and direct reports.  No computer questions to fill out.  This valuable approach results in a concise document depicting strengths, challenges, specific quotes from participants (anonymous of course) and recommendations for development.  This document serves as a foundation for the coaching plan and continued focus.
